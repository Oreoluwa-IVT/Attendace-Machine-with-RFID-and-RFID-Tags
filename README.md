# Capture Attendance Using An RFID Reader and RFID Tags

I got to assemble and code an atmega328pu Micro controller to read data from an RFID Tag with a few friends. 

## Installation Process

1 Download the Arduino IDE and Install the software on your PC/Mac. 
2 Clone this Repo.
3 Copy and Paste the Embedded C Code into your Arduino IDE 
4 Set Up your Circuit on a breadboard
5 Compile the Pasted Code and Arduino IDE 
6 Upload the Code to your Arduino
